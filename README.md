Zing is an online translation server software. We [use it at
Evernote](https://translate.evernote.com/) as a translation UI on top of
[Serge](https://serge.io) — our continuous localization backend. Zing
originates from the [Pootle](http://pootle.translatehouse.org/) project and
still shares much of the DNA with it, but stays aligned with our [goals and
vision](https://github.com/evernote/zing/blob/master/GOALS.md).

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Zing adheres to [semantic
versioning](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4), and as such backward incompatible
changes can be expected anytime before reaching v1.0.


Installation
------------

We are [currently working](https://github.com/evernote/zing/issues/25) to
provide an out-of-the-box installation method. In the mean-time, one can
experiment to run Zing from source, although we are not committed to support
it.


Copying
-------

Zing is released under the General Public License, version 3 or later. See the
[LICENSE](https://github.com/evernote/zing/blob/master/LICENSE) file for
